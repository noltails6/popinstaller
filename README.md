I may update it at some point and completely change it to PopManager

# popinstaller
a thing that helps install custom mvm missions into tf2
# HOW TO GET BECAUSE NOT EVery one knows how to download releases off of github
find the "Releases" thats usually on the right and download `popinstaller.cmd`
# HOW TO USE!!!!!!!!!!!!
## STEP ONE!!!!!!
drag and drop your pop file into the program after opening it
## STEP TWO!!!!!!
tell the script the map name
## STEP THREE!!!!!!
name your mission
## STEP FOUR!!!!!!
give it your tf2 directory location
for most people this would be `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\`
## STEP FIVE!!!!!!
literally wait half a second for it to process
## STEP SIX!!!!!!
# PROFIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
now open tf2, go to the map the mission is for, call a vote, change mission, pick the mission, and get your balls ripped off by hoards of robots
